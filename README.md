A data driven web app to analyze mass shootings in the US

# User stories

### Esri part
* [x] A user can see whether a map highlights the city which have had a mass shootings
* [x] By hovering over the state, a user can see the mass shootings that have occurred in that state with the total number of victims.
TODO, maybe add a description if it doesn't bloat the UI too much

Can only proceed once the tweets have been obtained

### HP on demand part
* [ ] Get the sentiment value from each tweet regarding gun control
* [x] Place those sentiment values on two choropleths maps


### UI work
* [x] Front page has an embedded map from Esri, which displays mass shootings over the year in the US
* [x] Tab to another page that has a choropleth maps between the divide on the country on gun control

# TODO
* [x] make it so that each map has unique data - fixed
- start working on the backend of requests, start with twitter -> hp on demand -> display

* [ ] create a reset to clear the choropleth down to 0
